- Config: For global variables (ex: default.json for mongodb)
- Gravatar: For profile avatars
- jsonwebtoken: We're using JWT and this helps with web tokens
- Mongoose: MongoDB helper
- Request: Helps us make http requests

## Package Installation

```bash
npm i express express-validator bcryptjs config gravatar jsonwebtoken mongoose request uuid

# Dev Dependencies

- Nodemon: Refreshes the server after saves
- Concurrently: Allows us to run our backend express server and front end react dev server with a single command

## Dev Dependencies Installation for Server

```bash
npm i -D nodemon concurrently
```

## Dev Dependencies Installation for Client (React)

Change directory to the client folder in the root directory. Then install dependencies.

```bash
cd client
npm i axios react-router-dom redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-devtools-extension moment react-moment uuid
```

# Software

Then in package.json, under "scripts" : {} add
